### Dev Bootcamp Phase 3 Final Project

Our project is a mobile game that was inspired by the "six degrees of separation" concept, the idea that any two people on Earth are 6 or fewer acquaintance links apart. There is a popular consensus that Kevin Bacon can be linked to any other actor following the same guidelines. We decided turn that into an enjoyable game - Cold Bacon.

### Installation of App
Coming soon

### Playing Cold Bacon
When you launch the app you are taken to the launch screen. Press start to begin your journey. The user will be given two randomly generated actors (they must meet a specific popularity requirement to be considered on the game start screen). The actor on the top of the screen will be your starting actor, and you must find a path to the ending actor, located at the bottom of the screen.

Clicking the starting actor's photo will take you to the game play screen, where you will see a list of 8 movies - 3 of those films will be the actors most well-known roles, and the other 5 (assuming the actor has credits in at least 8 movies) will be a collection of the most popular films by popularity rating that the actor has also played a role in. Once you click on a movie, that movies 8 top billed cast members will appear. Follow this pattern until you find a path through different actors and movies, that will lead you to a cast that your ending actor played a role in.

You win! The results page will display your bacon number and the different paths you took to arrive at your ending actor. Congrats!
